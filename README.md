# MathViz
A Mathematics calculator tool for Engineering Mathematics 1, 2, 3<br>
The application provides an interactive way of learning Engineering mathematics 1, 2, 3.<br>
It is currently being updated on regular basis.<br>
<h3>The project is currently being incubated under Mathematics department of our college</h3>.<br>
The app consists of input fields for user to enter the parameters for particular Math concepts such as:<br>
Numerical methods: A mathematical concept to solve ordinary differential equations.<br>
    1. Newton's Forward Difference Interpolation.<br>
    2. Newton's Backward Difference Interpolation.<br>
    3. Trapezoidal Rule.<br>
    4. Simpsons 1/3rd Rule.<br>
    5. Simpsons 3/8th Rule.<br>
    6. Euler's Method.<br>
    7. Modified Euler's Method.<br>
    8. Runge-Kutta Method of 4th Order.<br>
